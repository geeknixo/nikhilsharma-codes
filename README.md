I have made mulitple projects like Bug Bard, Snake water gun game and Javrvis a virtual assistant. 
explanations of projects- 

Project: Bug Bard
As part of my college coursework, I developed a front-end for a software development service website called Bug Bard. The project involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
create an engaging and user-friendly interface. I integrated icons from Font Awesome and incorporated various design elements sourced from different websites to enhance the
visual appeal and functionality. Additionally, I prepared a comprehensive synopsis report detailing the projectâ€™s objectives, design choices, and implementation process.

Project: Snake Water Gun Game
For my online course project, I developed a Snake Water Gun game using core Python. This game functions similarly to the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors format, allowing players 
to engage in a fun and interactive experience. I focused on implementing game logic and ensuring a smooth user interface, enhancing my programming skills and understanding of
Python fundamentals.

Project: Snake Water Gun Game
As part of my online course, I created a Snake Water Gun game using core Python. The game operates in the VS Code terminal and follows a format similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors, 
allowing players to compete in a text-based environment. This project enhanced my programming skills and deepened my understanding of game logic in Python.
